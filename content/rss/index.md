# What is RSS?

RSS is a universal subscribe buttonâ€”a simple protocol that allows you to stay up-to-date with you favourite creators. It powers all [podcasts](https://castos.com/podcast-rss-feed/) and is used widely to distribute many [newspapers](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html) and [blogs](https://seths.blog/subscribe/).

Sadly, RSS feeds are rarely advertised because they aren't very monetizable. There are no ads, algorithms, or other dark patterns. Like email, it is a simple, time-tested technology that accomplishes one thing and does it well.

To get started, install an RSS reader. Personally, I use the excellent [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com/) ($5) app on my iPad, but [NetNewsWire](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210) (free), [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome/logged-out) and [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) are excellent alternatives.
