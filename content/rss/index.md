# What is RSS?

RSS is a universal subscribe buttonâ€”a simple protocol that allows you to stay up-to-date with you favourite creators. Podcasts all use RSS to publish new episodes, but it is also used widely by [newspapers](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html) and [writers](https://seths.blog/subscribe/). [HowStuffWorks](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/rss.htm) provides a great overview.

Unfortunately, few people know about it. Those who do, however, love it: my personal feed is curated exactly to my tastes. No ads, no clickbait, no drama.

# How to use it

In order to follows particular feeds, you need an RSS reader. Personally, I use the excellent [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com/) ($5) app on my iPad. It looks something like this:

[NetNewsWire](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210) (free) is an excellent alternative. Other popular options are [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome/logged-out) and [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/).

# Newsletter

In the near future, I'll be making a newsletter where I share my writing, my photos, and the most interesting things I read.
