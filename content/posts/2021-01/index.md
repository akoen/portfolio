# What I'm doing right now

Just last week I started my first ever real job working for an engineering company (https://kardium.com/) that makes devices for heart surgery. I really like it so far as I get to analyze a lot of data, do math with it, and work in a labâ€”the kind of stuff I enjoy.

Otherwise, I've been skiing on weekends and getting outside when I can like usual.
