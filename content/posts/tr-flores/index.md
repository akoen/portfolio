Last week my dad and I—along with a few of his friends—circumnavigated Flores Island by kayak. It took us six days and featured whales, wolves, my favourite place on earth and a terrifying midnight meeting with the ocean.

We left Tofino on a sunny Tuesday afternoon. We paddled for a few hours until the winds began to rise and then camped on a gravel beach tucked away on a small island on the north shore of Vargas Island.

With nothing better to do, we paddled around the island for sunset.

Vargas is known for its wildlife, and I awoke early the next morning to the sound of my dad yelling "wolf, wolf!" Unfortunately, by the time I mustered the energy to leave my sleeping bag it had ducked back in to the forest.

By the time we embarked our kayaks were shrouded in fog.

After another short paddle, we arrived at White Sand Cove, a sandy beach on Flores Island. Given that it was only mid-afternoon, Osa and I decided to explore. Others told of a natural spring on the shoreline that someone had fashioned into an outdoor pool, only a few kilometres away. It proved to be well hidden, but after almost four hours of searching we managed to find it.

The water was tepid and crystal-clear:

Again, the sunset that evening was stunning.

Friday was the first long day of paddling. Between White Sand Cove and our destination, Sharpe Point, lay over twenty kilometres of inhospitable coastline, exposed entirely to swells from the Pacific. Thankfully the wind was mild that day, and after five hours we reached our destination. Along the way we saw a variety of wildlife: seals, otters, whales and a few of the largest jellyfish known to man.

We camped on a crescent beach, sheltered from the swells by the adjacent peninsula.

As soon as we disembarked, it began to rain. A sputter at first, then rain. Regardless, we had come a long way, and decided to cross the inlet to visit Hot Springs Cove regardless. 

Little did we know, the springs—normally a popular attraction for tourists—had been closed for many months due to construction. As a result, the trail was completely overgrown. Again, we bushwhacked for hours, the drizzle only intensifying. The others soon gave up and once again only Osa and I pressed on. I too had nearly accepted defeat when I stumbled across a miracle: ticker tape, accompanied by a faint trail.

We followed the trail, dodging fallen trees and enormous slugs, for thirty minutes before finding the main path: a beautiful boardwalk running lengthwise down the peninsula.

Twenty minutes later we reached Hot Springs Cove: my favourite place on earth. Here, on the tip of a remote peninsula accessible only by boat or by plane, a piping hot stream erupts from the ground, flows over a waterfall and through a series of pools before being consumed by the ocean. 

To me, it represents the epitome of West Coast magic, and that day we had it to ourselves. It was a moment of bliss on a grimy day. I didn't take any pictures.

The next day the rain subsided and we paddled another twenty kilometres to a beach marked on our map. Unfortunately, it didn't exist. We searched around, peeking into inlet after inlet, but never found it. In the end, the best spot we could find was a grassy swamp at the head of a river featuring only a few dry spots at treeline.

It wasn't pleasant, but all was well—at least I thought. At midnight, I woke up and rolled over straight into the ocean. The tide had risen much higher than anticipated—almost three metres—and my mattress was floating in six inches of water. Horrified, I called out to the others. "Tide! I'm underwater!"

Fortunately, they were spared. The tide had almost peaked, and the water stopped only inches from their tents. My sleeping bag and other gear were totally soaked and so I crawled into my dad's tent and went back to sleep.

Needless to say, that event put a downer on the whole trip, but luckily it was almost over. We had only one more night, and we camped on 'Cable Beach', which wouldn't be out of place in the Carribean.

It was a trip full of ups and downs, but I will remember it for years to come. To me, this area epitomizes the beauty of the West Coast and I feel so lucky to be able to explore it, if only for a few days.
