Our world is dying; we need a climate revolution. But every year, we're using less-and-less low-carbon energy. From 1995 to now, the percentage of the world's energy produced by low-carbon means has dropped from 37% to 33%. That isn't drastic, but it isn't sustainable either---if we don't change we're going to kill the planet.

The obvious solution is investment in renewable energy. Not only is this good for the planet, it makes financial sense. The diagram below shows the levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, for common renewable and conventional energy sources. This metric describes the cost for which a power plant must sell electricity in order to make a profit over the lifetime of the project.

In general, solar and wind are the cheapest means of energy production, even compared to fossil fuels. Yet solar and wind are intermittent---they don't produce power when the sun isn't out or when the wind isn't blowing. What's more, there are few effective ways of storing the excess energy they create. Batteries are still too expensive and pumped-storage hydropower (pumping water uphill to later run it through a turbine) only works in mountainous regions.

Consequently, renewables must often be supplemented by another energy source capable of generating baseload: the minimum energy consumption of a region over a prolonged period of time. In regions where there are no clear alternatives like geothermal or hydropower, this demand must often be supplied by fossil fuels.

# The answer is nuclear

There is, however, a far better solution: nuclear. Nuclear fission provides near-infinite energy from abundant fuel in the second most efficient process known to man (after the sun, which we'll get to).

What's more, contrary to common belief, nuclear is minimally harmful to the environment. For scale, the average Canadian is responsible for approximately 15,000 kilograms of COâ‚‚ emissions per [year](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?locations=US). In contrast, in a nuclear society that number would fall to roughly 40 grams of spent nuclear fuel.

Public opinion of nuclear energy is largely negative. After the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, 62% of the surveyed population around the world said they were opposed to the technology.

This number is a high as 80% in many first-world countries like Germany, who in the wake of the disaster vowed to shut down all nuclear power plants across the country.

# Nuclear energy isn't green, but it's far better than fossil fuels

Since Germany began shutting down their plants, the energy deficit been not filled with green technologies, but rather with coal---and coal is far, far worse.

As shown in the following graph, nuclear is far safer than all fossil fuels and---by recent estimates---is safer than wind, solar, and hydro. Yet

Quoting environmentalist and Guardian columnist George Monbiot, who actually changed his views in favour of nuclear after the Fukushima disaster:

> A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting. Yet, as far as we know, no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation.

# Nuclear is scary

People are more scared of flying in planes than driving in cars despite knowing that planes are far safer. The prospect of another nuclear disaster resulting in a Chernobyl-style exclusion zone leads policy-makers to shut down nuclear reactors while fossil fuels are slowly turning our entire planet into an exclusion zone.

Renewables are a solution, but they cannot be the only solution.
