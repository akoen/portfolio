Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a nineteen-year-old engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I strongly believe that writing is the most effective way to understand anything. It forces us to confront inconsistencies in our thinking, distill our thinking into words, and then present those words in a manner that is understandable. If we cannot do this, then we do not understand the subject. 

I would love to hear your thoughts about my writing---or about anything else. There is nothing more special to me than meeting new people.

Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:alex@koen.ca).
