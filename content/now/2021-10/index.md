In the thick of school now. My course load is heavy, but I'm having a great time. My courses are interesting, I've made plenty of new friends, and I haven't yet been bomblasted by any midterms.

Thankfully, I've managed to get out a few times. Here's [Lukas](https://theinsignificanceproject.wordpress.com/) and I on Marriot. The scenery is absolutely stunning this time of year.

I've also tried to do the Grind as much as possible to maintain my fitness. I'm finally running times under 40 minutesâ€”a huge improvement that I'm really proud of.
