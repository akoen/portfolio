This past month has again been simple. Most memorably, my good friend and I skied an ultra-classic couloir north of Pemberton that we had been talking about for some time.

Only after talking about it with my family did my dad casually remark that he was part of its first ever ski descent back in the day. Unfortunately, he could only ski the bottom half for all he had were lace-up mountaineering boots and strap-on bindings, but I still found that remarkably impressive.

Other than that, I'm still working and trying to figure out what to do with myself over the coming months. School won't be in person for another term, and so I'm thinking of extending my co-op or taking some time off.

On an unrelated note, here is a husky in a backpack:
