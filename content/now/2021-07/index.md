After six months, I finished my internship at Kardium. I can't express enough how thankful I am to my colleagues who taught me valuable skills and give me the most interesting work I could ask for. I hope to return next year.

My good friend [Ian](https://ianharlandphotography.com/nature) got really excited to photograph a stunning new climb, The Spirit of Squamish, that weaves its way next to Shannon Falls. While we were doing our thing, a drone decided to join in on the fun. Typically that would be disrespectful, but the operator was kind and shared his footage.
