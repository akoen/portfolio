I finally published [The Importance of Privacy](/posts/privacy), an essay born from countless discussions and debates with my closest friends. I'm seriously proud of it, and hope that it gives people the perspective to understand an underappreciated threat.

After a month of searching, I signed a lease on a suite in Vancouver with my friend Kamran. I couldn't be more excited for him to be my roommateâ€”even though University this year will be difficult, it's going to be a lot of fun.

I very nearly achieved a goal I've been training for: running the Grouse Grind in under 40 minutes. It took me 40:00.

I climbed relentlessly, and did several trips. Two of these stood out: [Sleeping on the summit of Alpha](/posts/tr-alpha) and the [Viennese-Clarke traverse](/posts/tr-vctraverse).
