Sadly, my most ambitious trips planned for August were all cancelled due to sickness or injury. It was frustrating to abandon my goals for the summer, but in the end I made some beautiful memories.

- My dad and I paddled around [Flores Island](/posts/tr-flores), visited my favourite place on earth, and almost got swept away by the ocean.

- My mom, her friend, and I hiked the [West Coast Trail](/posts/tr-wct) over six days.

- I did a number of fantastic local day trips with my closest friends.

Also, I moved into a new place! My friend Kam and I are now renting a sweet bachelor pad in Kits, and loving it. This feels like the last step in becoming an adult.

School is already stressful, but it's so nice to be back in person. I've already made friends, and having classes with them makes it all the more bearable.

Life is hectic, but as exciting as ever.
