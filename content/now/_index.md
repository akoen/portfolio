# What I'm doing right now

School has been extremely challenging, especially because of the apocalypse, and this month I got quite sick from stress and Zoom. As a result, I dropped two courses, but I'm looking forward to taking them in person.

My dad finished building me a beautiful desk, which I've absolutely loved working on.

Otherwise, I've been working mostly on coursework and side projects (trying to write my own neural network), but always make time on Saturdays to get outside.

Cheerio.
