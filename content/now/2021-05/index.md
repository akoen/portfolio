The sun is shining and the snow is melting. April marked the last ski days of the season for me, and while I will miss them dearly, I couldn't be more excited to hang up my gear and enjoy the good weather.

The highlight of the month was skiing off the summit of Garibaldi and neighbouring Tent on a beautiful day with good company.

Here's me breaking trail the *entire* way up, as my partner had already summited that week and couldn't be bothered:

In other news, I'm extending my internship at Kardium for another two months and then taking the rest of the summer off before returning to school in the fall. The work is more interesting than ever and I'm already making the best of my spare time.
