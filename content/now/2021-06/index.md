May was a crazy month. The weather was (mostly) fantastic and my friend Lukas and I climbed as if our lives depended on it. Here are a few highlights:

The Great Game in Squamish. This was Lukas' hardest ever lead:

The Goat in Marble Canyon. 11a/18 pitches. We did it in 8 pitches, and in less than six hours car to car:

The Grand Wall. It started raining on us a few minutes after this photo, but we pressed on. Two hours later, I started up the crux pitch only to fall off of wet holds. We had to retreat, but still had a blast:

It was a great month. It feels good to move fast and to be able to dedicate as much time as I have to a meaningless sport like climbing. I feel lucky.
