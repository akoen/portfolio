Life has gained structure: I work during the week and ski on weekends. It's a balance that I'm enjoying, although I'm sure that the novelty of the 9â€“5 will soon wear off. Nevertheless, I'm having a great time. Here's my friend Tobias boot-packing up a couloir we skied near Whistler:

A few weeks ago my dad brought me out to Hope for the long-weekend to learn to ice climb. It's the most fun, yet most miserable sport I've ever tried. Needless to say, I'm hooked.

Yesterday, I bullied myself into skiing off my largest cliff yet (bigger than it looks; probably 26 or 27 ft). My friends tell me I need to work on my landings, but I don't believe them.

That's been my month. Get outside and give yourself a break. You probably deserve it.
