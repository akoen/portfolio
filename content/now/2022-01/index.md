After breaking my back for four months at school, the winter break was much needed and well deserved. I spent Christmas with my dad and his partner Osa at his new place in Kaslo, a small town in interior BC.

Given the less-than-stunning reliability of my Mazda, I opted to take the bus. Luckily, a Kaslo local runs a bus service from Vancouver every few days. It should take about 9 hours. It took us 17. Bad weather, icy roads, and seats that didn't recline made for once of the least comfortable experiences of my life, but I made it.

Luckily, the rest of the trip was lovely. It snowed like never before. We shovelled the driveway three times a day. We skied around town. Christmas felt right.

The highlight of the trip was two nights at a ski cabin hidden away in the local mountains. With almost limitless terrain, it's likely the best backcountry playground I know of.

Overall, it was a delightful trip. Kaslo is a beautiful town and I look forward to visiting again soon. While I'm now back on the 9â€“5 grind, my weekends are looking suspiciously empty...
